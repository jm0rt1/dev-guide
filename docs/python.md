# Python Tips


## Python Development Guide

### 1. [Use Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
Virtual environments allow you to keep the dependencies of different projects separate. Tools like `venv` and `virtualenv` can help you create isolated Python environments.

### 2. [Formatting and Linting](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
Consistent code style makes your project easier to read and maintain. Use tools like `black` or `autopep8` for automatic formatting, and `pylint` or `flake8` for linting. You can even set up pre-commit hooks to auto-format your code when you make a commit.

### 3. [Testing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
Regular testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and catching bugs early. The `unittest` module in Python's standard library provides tools for creating and running tests. Libraries like `pytest` and `nose` offer more advanced features.

### 4. [Use Type Hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
Starting with Python 3.5, you can use type hints in your function signatures, which can make your code easier to understand and debug.

### 5. [Error Handling](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
Make good use of Python's exception handling features. It's better to catch exceptions explicitly than to have your program crash unexpectedly.

### 6. [Use List Comprehensions and Generators](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)
These Python features can make your code more readable and efficient, especially when dealing with large data sets.

### 7. [Documenting Your Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)
Make sure to provide useful comments and docstrings for your classes, methods, and functions. Tools like Sphinx can automatically generate HTML documentation from your docstrings.

### 8. [Packaging and Distribution](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
If you want others to use your code, make it available as a package that can be easily installed. Python's setuptools library can help with this, and you can distribute your packages on platforms like PyPI.

### 9. [Use Python's Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html)
Python's standard library is very powerful, and can help you perform a variety of tasks without the need for external libraries. Be sure to explore it.

### 10. [Learn to Use Python's Debugging Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html)
The `pdb` module is a powerful tool for debugging Python programs. Learning to use it effectively can save you a lot of time.

### 11. [Learn to Use Profiling Tools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)
Profiling can help you identify bottlenecks in your code. Python includes a built-in profiler, and there are also powerful external tools like `cProfile` and `snakeviz`.

### 12. [Use CI/CD Tools](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/building-and-testing-python)
Continuous integration and continuous delivery can help you maintain code quality by running tests automatically and ensuring that your code works in different environments.




## Folder Structure

The assets/ folder can be used to store image files or other static resources used by your application. The cache/ directory can be used to store temporary files that are expensive to compute and can be reused. The gui/ folder could contain files related to the graphical user interface of your application, if it has one. The lib/ directory could hold C/C++ libraries, if your project uses some. The scripts/ directory is often used for standalone scripts that may be run independently of the main application, such as data processing or data migration scripts. Finally, the logs/ directory is a good place to store log files, which can be very useful for debugging and understanding the behavior of your application.
